# Advent of Code 2017, Day 12

A very straightforward graph problem.  I blanked trying to think of a simpler representation for the graph.  I used a Node class, which I just *knew* wasn't best.  Now that I've completed the challenge and I'm not rushing, I see a natural representation would have been an n-by-n matrix.  My code would have been much simpler.

And now I see at least one solution (in Python) that doesn't even bother with that, and is half the size of my solution.
