--- Part Two ---
Now that you're starting to get a feel for the dance moves, you turn your attention to the dance as a whole.

Keeping the positions they ended up in from their previous dance, the programs perform it again and again: including the first dance, a total of one billion (1000000000) times.

In the example above, their second dance would begin with the order `baedc`, and use the same dance moves:

- `s1`, a spin of size 1: `cbaed`.
- `x3/4`, swapping the last two programs: `cbade`.
- `pe/b`, swapping programs e and b: `ceadb`.

In what order are the programs standing after their billion dances?
