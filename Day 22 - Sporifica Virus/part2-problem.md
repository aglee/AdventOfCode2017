--- Part Two ---

As you go to remove the virus from the infected nodes, it evolves to resist your attempt.

Now, before it infects a clean node, it will weaken it to disable your defenses. If it encounters an infected node, it will instead flag the node to be cleaned in the future. So:

- Clean nodes become weakened.
- Weakened nodes become infected.
- Infected nodes become flagged.
- Flagged nodes become clean.

Every node is always in exactly one of the above states.

The virus carrier still functions in a similar way, but now uses the following logic during its bursts of action:

- Decide which way to turn based on the current node:
	- If it is clean, it turns left.
	- If it is weakened, it does not turn, and will continue moving in the same direction.
	- If it is infected, it turns right.
	- If it is flagged, it reverses direction, and will go back the way it came.
- Modify the state of the current node, as described above.
- The virus carrier moves forward one node in the direction it is facing.

Start with the same map (still using `.` for clean and `#` for infected) and still with the virus carrier starting in the middle and facing up.

Using the same initial state as the previous example, and drawing weakened as `W` and flagged as `F`, the middle of the infinite grid looks like this, with the virus carrier's position again marked with `[ ]`:

```plain
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . # . . .
. . . #[.]. . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
```

This is the same as before, since no initial nodes are weakened or flagged. The virus carrier is on a clean node, so it still turns left, instead weakens the node, and moves left:

```plain
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . # . . .
. . .[#]W . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
```

The virus carrier is on an infected node, so it still turns right, instead flags the node, and moves up:

```plain
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . .[.]. # . . .
. . . F W . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
```

This process repeats three more times, ending on the previously-flagged node and facing right:

```plain
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . W W . # . . .
. . W[F]W . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
```

Finding a flagged node, it reverses direction and cleans the node:

```plain
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . W W . # . . .
. .[W]. W . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
```

The weakened node becomes infected, and it continues in the same direction:

```plain
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . W W . # . . .
.[.]# . W . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
```

Of the first 100 bursts, 26 will result in infection. Unfortunately, another feature of this evolved virus is speed; of the first 10000000 bursts, 2511944 will result in infection.

Given your actual map, after 10000000 bursts of activity, how many bursts cause a node to become infected? (Do not count nodes that begin infected.)
