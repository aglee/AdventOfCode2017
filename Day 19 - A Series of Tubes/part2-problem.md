--- Part Two ---

The packet is curious how many steps it needs to go.

For example, using the same routing diagram from the example above...

```plain
     |          
     |  +--+    
     A  |  C    
 F---|--|-E---+ 
     |  |  |  D 
     +B-+  +--+ 
```

...the packet would go:

- 6 steps down (including the first line at the top of the diagram).
- 3 steps right.
- 4 steps up.
- 3 steps right.
- 4 steps down.
- 3 steps right.
- 2 steps up.
- 13 steps left (including the `F` it stops on).

This would result in a total of 38 steps.

How many steps does the packet need to go?
