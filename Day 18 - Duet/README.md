# Advent of Code 2017, Day 18

Whereas Day 16 had me shaking my fist a bit at Swift strings, today's puzzle felt like a good fit for Swift.  Also, this was a case where my kneejerk impulse to wrap stuff in a class was reasonable.

After solving Part 1 I mangled the code to solve Part 2.  Afterwards I went back and retrofitted the code so it solves both parts.

Impressive: on the subreddit, etotheipi1 figured out [what the program actually does](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7kj35s/2017_day_18_solutions/dreucbm/), by manually decompiling the assembly.
