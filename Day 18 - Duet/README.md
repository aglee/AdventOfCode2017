# Advent of Code 2017, Day 18

Whereas Day 16 had me shaking my fist a bit at Swift strings, today's puzzle felt like a good fit for Swift.  Also, this was a case where my kneejerk impulse to wrap stuff in a class was reasonable.

After solving Part 1 I mangled the code to solve Part 2.  Afterwards I went back and retrofitted the code so it solves both parts.
