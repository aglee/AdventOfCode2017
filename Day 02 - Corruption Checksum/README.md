# Advent of Code 2017, Day 2

Realized afterwards I could have coded Part 1 a little quicker by sorting each row and taking the first and last elements, instead of iterating the row elements.  For the small data size, the difference in execution time would have been negligible.  Then, conveniently, I would already have had the sorted-row code ready to use for Part 2.
