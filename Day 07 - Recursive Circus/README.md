# Advent of Code 2017, Day 7

My original code did not spit out the actual answer to Part 2.  Rather, it printed a messy bunch of stuff that I eyeballed in order to figure out the answer.  I pushed that original code, warts and all, to GitHub.  Then I went back and cleaned it up somewhat so that it does spit out the answer, consistent with my other solutions for this year's Advent of Code.  As part of the cleanup I also used `reduce(_,_)`, `first(where:)`, and `max(by:)` to make the code more concise.

I tested my Part 1 code on the example input -- and then submitted that result as my answer because I forgot to run the code on the actual input.

I made sort of the opposite mistake on Part 2.  I didn't test at all on the example input before submitting an answer.  That was a blunder, because (for me at least) this was a tricky enough problem that I should have known better than to trust my code.
