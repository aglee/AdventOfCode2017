# Notes on Advent of Code 2017, Day 1

It occurred to me afterwards that in `solve2()` I could have saved time by only testing half the digits, but the runtime savings would have been negligible and not worth the extra coding time.

Some time after making the above observation, I realized I'd have to double the result, which I would very likely have neglected to do.  So it wouldn't have been worth the cleverness.  Glad I stuck with the simplest logic.
